This project is a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), [Kernelsu](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) module for Clash, mihomo, sing-box, v2ray, xray, hysteria. It supports REDIRECT (TCP only), TPROXY (TCP + UDP) transparent proxy, TUN (TCP + UDP), and hybrid mode REDIRECT (TCP) + TUN (UDP) proxy.

Based on upstream integration for one-stop service, ready to use. Suitable for:
- Lazy people
- Beginners

The project's theme and configuration focus on [mihomo.Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/Clash.Meta).

This module needs to be used in a Magisk/Kernelsu environment. If you don't know how to configure the required environment, you might need applications like ClashForAndroid, v2rayNG, surfboard, SagerNet, AnXray.

## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. First Use</summary>

- After installing the module, no need to restart the device. You can use `Toolbox` to integrate and refresh the client update status.
- After installation is complete, add your subscription address to `config.yaml` and restart the module service via the switch.
- Due to network reasons, all **rules**/**subscriptions** may not be downloaded automatically. Please manually refresh in the panel.
  - If the above fails, ensure your network environment is normal.
- Web App: [Download](https://github.com/MoGuangYu/Surfing/raw/main/folder/Web_v5.5_release.apk) | [View Source](./folder/main.lua)
  - It is only a graphical auxiliary tool used for portable browsing and managing the backend route data, with no other unnecessary uses.

> The module has a built-in GUI that can be accessed locally via a browser or used online via the app. There is essentially no difference between the two.

<summary>4. Future Updates</summary>  

- If you use all the default configurations, updates will be seamless.  
- The module supports online updates within the client. After updating, no reboot is required; however, the module switch's enable/disable control ~~may temporarily not work and still require a reboot~~ or can be updated via Toolbox.  
- During updates, the configuration file will be backed up to:  
   - `config.yaml.bak`  
- During updates, the old user configuration files will be backed up to:  
   - `box.config.bak`  
- During updates, your subscription URLs will be automatically extracted and backed up to:  
   - `subscribe_urls_backup.txt`  
   - The backup will be automatically extracted and restored into the new configuration, applicable when using the default configuration file.  
- The module update does NOT include:  
   - Geo database files  
   - Binary files  
   - Web resources  

> Note: Updates mainly follow upstream changes and distribute some configurations.

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

1. Proxy Specific Applications (Black/Whitelist)
- To proxy all applications except certain ones, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **not proxy** specific Android user applications.

- To only proxy specific applications, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **only proxy** specific Android user applications.

Android user group ID identifiers:

| Standard User | ID  |
| ------------- | --- |
| Owner         |  0  |
| Second Space  |  10 |
| App Clone     | 999 |

> Typically, you can find all user group IDs and application package names in `/data/user/`. Do not use fake-ip mode when using black/whitelist.

2. Tun Mode
- Enabled by default

> It is recommended to keep it enabled. It can be disabled if not needed, but do not use black/white lists when this mode is enabled.

3. Routing Rules
- Bypass mainland China
- It basically meets the needs of most daily usage.

> Black/whitelist is not significant unless strictly required. The module's built-in configuration is sufficient.

4. Panel Management
- Magisk Font Module

> May affect normal display of page fonts.

5. LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect.

> For other devices to access the console backend, just use (http://currentWiFigateway:9090/ui).
